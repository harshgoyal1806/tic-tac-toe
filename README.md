🎮 Tic Tac Toe
A fun and classic Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project brings the nostalgic pencil-and-paper game to the browser. Two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid — one as ❌ and the other as ⭕. The first to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins!

✨ Features
Sleek and responsive user interface

Real-time gameplay for two players on the same device

Smart win and draw detection

One-click reset to play again

Whether you're looking to relive your childhood or just kill a few minutes, this little project delivers a smooth and enjoyable experience.
